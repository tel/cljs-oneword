# One Word

Little demonstration of using Oak and Rococo to write web components.

## Usage

Just boot up a Figwheel for live development.

```
$ lein figwheel
```

then visit `http://localhost:3449`.

Although, you'll probably have to get modern versions of Oak and Rococo 
into your `checkouts` dir to make this really work.
